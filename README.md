Installation
------------

This script is intended for svn builds of XBMC. For the stable 9.11 release, check out the `master` branch.

To install, place the Transmission-XBMC folder in your XBMC plugins directory (usually `${HOME}/.xbmc/plugins`)

If your transmission daemon is running on a machine other than localhost, using a port other than 9091, or requires authentication, you will have to change the plugin settings before running it.
