Installation
------------

This script is intended for XBMC version 9.11. For more recent builds, check out the `xbmc-svn` branch.

To install, place the Transmission-XBMC folder in your XBMC scripts directory (usually `${HOME}/.xbmc/scripts`)

If your transmission daemon is running on a machine other than localhost, using a port other than 9091, or requires authentication, you will have to change the script settings before running it.
